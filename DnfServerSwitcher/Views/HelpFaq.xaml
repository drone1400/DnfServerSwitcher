                    At some point during development, the multiplayer system for DNF was overhauled.
                    However, some of the features of the old multiplayer system remain and can be accessed by modifying the system.ini configurations...
                    The old system is called "Deprecated" because well, it *was* deprecated.
                </Run>
            </TextBlock>
            
            <TextBlock>
                <Run FontWeight="Bold">What is Deprecated mode good for?</Run>
                <LineBreak/>
                <Run>
                    Deprecated mode allows for a player limit higher than 8 and, perhaps more importantly, 
                    it allows loading custom multiplayer maps!

                <LineBreak/>
                <Run>
                    DNF2011 uses UTF-16 encoding with no "byte order mark" for its .ini config files.
                    Saving the files with Notepad breaks this encoding and DNF2011 won't read the files anymore!
                </Run>
                <LineBreak/>
                <Run>
                    If you want to manually edit the .ini files you *must* use Notepad++ or a similar editor that preserves the exact encoding used.
                </Run>
                <LineBreak/>
                <Run>
                    NOTE: Saving the file with UTF-16 encoding but having the BOM (byte order mark) at the start of the file won't work either!

                    You can get Notepad++ on their official website here:

            <TextBlock>
                <Run FontWeight="Bold">My player name doesn't work in Deprecated, what do?</Run>
                <LineBreak/>
                <Run>
                    Unfortunately in Deprecated mode, you need to manually set the player name each map via a console command. 
                    Since the console is disabled by default, the easiest way to do it is to set a keybinding in the user.ini file to set the player name for you.
                    The binding must have this format:
                </Run>
                <LineBreak/>
                <Run FontStyle="Italic">
                    [KEY]=name [your name]
                </Run>
                <LineBreak/>
                <Run>
                    So for example, if you want to set your name to "John Duke" and bind it to the F11 key, the custom binding will look like this:
                </Run>
                <LineBreak/>
                <Run FontStyle="Italic">
                    F11=name John Duke
                </Run>
                <LineBreak/>
                <Run>
                    You only need to edit the user.ini file once, afterwards the binding will work every time you are in a Deprecated multiplayer map. 
                    Of course, you can use this application to automagically set the binding yourself.
                </Run>
            </TextBlock>
            
            <TextBlock>
                <Run FontWeight="Bold">Launching in Deprecated mode doesn't seem to work!?</Run>
                <LineBreak/>
                <Run>
                    Sometimes the DNF2011's Steam Cloud synchronization starts acting up and overwrites the modified system.ini file after you launch the game. 
                    If this happens, the launcher won't work as intended, as its changes get overriden by the Steam Cloud backup! 
                    To fix this you can try two things:
                </Run>
                <LineBreak/>
                <Run>
                    1. Click the 'Delete remotecache.vdf file' button to delete the remote cache file, this can *maybe* help resynchronize the Steam Cloud data for DNF2011...
                </Run>
                <LineBreak/>
                <Run>
                    2. If the problem persists, enable the option to update the system.ini and user.ini files automatically in the Steam cloud by ticking the corresponding checkbox. 
                    This means that before launching the game, the application will upload the modified system.ini and user.ini files directly to your DNF2011's Steam Cloud. 
                    NOTE: In order for this to work, you need to already have Steam open!
